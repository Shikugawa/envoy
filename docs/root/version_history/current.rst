1.17.2 (Pending)
==========================

Incompatible Behavior Changes
-----------------------------
*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

Bug Fixes
---------
*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*

* active http health checks: properly handles HTTP/2 GOAWAY frames from the upstream. Previously a GOAWAY frame due to a graceful listener drain could cause improper failed health checks due to streams being refused by the upstream on a connection that is going away. To revert to old GOAWAY handling behavior, set the runtime feature `envoy.reloadable_features.health_check.graceful_goaway_handling` to false.
* buffer: tighten network connection read and write buffer high watermarks in preparation to more careful enforcement of read limits. Buffer high-watermark is now set to the exact configured value; previously it was set to value + 1.
* http: reverting a behavioral change where upstream connect timeouts were temporarily treated differently from other connection failures. The change back to the original behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting `envoy.reloadable_features.treat_upstream_connect_timeout_as_connect_failure` to false.
* upstream: fix handling of moving endpoints between priorities when active health checks are enabled. Previously moving to a higher numbered priority was a NOOP, and moving to a lower numbered priority caused an abort.

Removed Config or Runtime
